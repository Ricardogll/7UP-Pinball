# Skatepark-Pinball
--------------------------
This game is a project from 2 students of CITM UPC Terrassa for the Physichs 2 subject based on Box2D.

The main goal is to create a pinball based on an already existing pinball game.

Our game will be based on this [Skatepark Pinball](https://www.classicgame.com/game/Skatepark+Pinball).
